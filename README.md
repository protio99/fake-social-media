# Fake social media new project 
Hello there! :wave: I'm here again to show you this new educational project. This time I'm trying to improve my JS Vanilla skills in order to level up my knowledge in Angular. Let's get started.
 
 ### What am I using here?
 I'm going to start listing different APIs and DOM-related things to explain how I used each one in the project and how they helped me solve specific problems. Later, I'm going to explain step by step the code
 - Fetch API 
 - Document Interface 
 - DOMContentLoaded document event
 - element.addEventListener
